# Major Change in the Course Schedule

## Rationale
The recent S20 CEE student workload survey that ran last week showed that the overall workload for remote learning is very challenging and stressful for most students. Our teaching team is on the same page. View counts on the lecture and tutorial videos have been sharply dropped for the last two weeks. We are thinking that students have been swamped with other course work, quizzes, or final project. Our teaching team has decided to reduce the amount of coursework again and will give you more time to focus on the core topics in this course. 

## Major Change
As we mentioned before, this course mainly focuses on improving your programming skill. Although MATLAB has many useful functions that might be used in your undergraduate study, we believe that you can easily learn how to use them once you are familiar with MATLAB programming. Thus, we will reduce some of those topics and will not deliver the corresponding lectures and tutorials.  Also, the topics on the posted videos (Module 01~ Module 08) are much more important than the ones in the following modules. It is better to give students time to watch and review those topics rather than giving a new topic. 

Here is the list of major schedule change:
* The lecture slides for Module 10 and 12 will be posted but there will be no lectures or tutorial videos. This means there will be no quiz problems from these modules. Students can study this topic later on your own when you need such functions in MATLAB for your undergraduate study.  
* There will be no HW #8. Instead, we will post more tutorial problems on Module 11 for students to prepare Quiz #4. They will receive full marks from HW #8.
* There is no lecture for Module 09. There is nothing much to talk about this topic in the lecture. Rather, we will show you how to draw graphs in MATLAB using hands-on examples in the tutorial (TUT08). There will be no quiz problem from this topic but we will post an extra mark question for drawing plot in LEARN soon. 

## List of the videos to be uploaded (estimated upload date)
*  HW#6 review video (July 14) 
*  TUT08 (July 16) 
*  Quiz #3 review video (July 16)
*  Lec09 and TUT09 (July 21)
*  Lec11 and TUT11 (July 28)
*  HW#7 review video (August 02)
*  Quiz #4 review video (August 06)

## Major dates for the rest of this course
*  Due date for the course evaluation (July 24) 
*  Quiz #3 (July 21)
*  Quiz #4 (August 11)
*  First and second due date for HW#7 (July 29, August 02)  

## Action items for the rest of this course
*  Watch and review all lecture and tutorial videos. 
*  Watch and review all homework review videos. 
*  Type and run all model scripts and compare them with your solutions. 
*  Start working on HW#7 as soon as possible because it requires designing many functions to solve the problem. 
*  Review all quiz solutions. 
*  Write a vectorized script to solve the problems in the rest of assignments and quizzes. 

## Homework Submissions
*  submission required only for HW #7.
